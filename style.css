The main theme stylesheet can be found in the assets/css/main.css file.
If you want to edit the main stylesheet (not recommended), be sure that the "minified CSS" option is not checked in the theme settings

For any CSS customization, it is strongly recommended to use a child theme
see http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes

You will find a child theme template in your %NAME% theme package
